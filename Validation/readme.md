# Validation
The files Validation I and Validation II have, respectively, distinct representations of the same polymers with their canonical BigSMILES and the canonical BigSMILES of several materials. 

The zip files contain the figures generated while the code produced Validation I and Validation II. Each sub-folder has the results for a polymer.
